## AIâ€‘Gift Concierge

This repository contains a minimal **AIâ€‘powered gift recommender** web application.  
Users answer a few simple questions (occasion, budget and interests) and the service
returns a curated list of gift suggestions along with affiliate search phrases.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a lean MVP that can be
extended into a fullyâ€‘fledged product.  The current implementation
relies on the OpenAI API to generate personalized recommendations,
but it also includes a fallback mode with static suggestions for
development or demo purposes.

### Features

* ðŸ§  **AIâ€‘driven suggestions:** Each query is turned into a short list of
  gift ideas tailored to the recipientâ€™s interests and budget.  The model
  produces product names, brief descriptions and search keywords that
  can be linked to affiliate programs (e.g. Amazon, eBay).
* ðŸ“„ **Simple form interface:** The frontâ€‘end is a single page that collects
  occasion, budget and interests, then displays results without reloading.
* ðŸ”„ **API fallback:** If the OpenAI API is not configured (no
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` provided), the application returns a predefined list
  of sample suggestions so you can test the UI and workflow.

### Quick start

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key
(optional).  Without a key the app will fall back to static suggestions.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
python app.py
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:5000`.  Navigate
to the page, fill in the form and review the generated suggestions.

### Deployment

This code is intentionally minimal.  For production use you will want
to add proper error handling, rate limiting, caching and possibly
background tasks for longâ€‘running operations.  You can deploy this app
to any platform that supports Python, such as Heroku, Render or a
container orchestrator like Docker.
